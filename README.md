# React Addressbook App

  

Main packages that the project contains

* **react-router-dom** for navigation
* **Ant Design Library** for ui components
* **Mobx** for state management
* **react-infinite-scroller** for infinite scroll feature on addressbook grid

I used Eslint and prettier to validate code style.

## Steps to run

  After clonning to reposistory enter the project directory and run the following codes in order:
  * npm install
  * npm run
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (if it doesn't open automatically).

To run tests use:
  * npm test
